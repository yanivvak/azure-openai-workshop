    "Parameters \n",
    "Generally, we find that model and temperature are the most commonly used parameters to alter the model output.\n",
    "\n",
    "model - Higher performance models are generally more expensive and may have higher latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "temperature - A measure of how often the model outputs a less likely token. The higher the temperature, the more random (and usually creative) the output. This, however, is not the same as “truthfulness”. For most factual use cases such as data extraction, and truthful Q&A, the temperature of 0 is best.\n",
    "\n",
    "max_tokens (maximum length) - Does not control the length of the output, but a hard cutoff limit for token generation. Ideally you won’t hit this limit often, as your model will stop either when it thinks it’s finished, or when it hits a stop sequence you defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "stop (stop sequences) - A set of characters (tokens) that, when generated, will cause the text generation to stop.\n"
