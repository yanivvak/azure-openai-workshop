# 🚀 Quick Start Guide: Security Analytics with ADX

This guide gets you from zero to enterprise security analytics in 3 simple steps.

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy Everything
```bash
cd adx/terraform
./deploy-adx-complete.sh
```
**What this does:** Deploys Azure Data Explorer cluster, database, schema, and all connections automatically.

### Step 2: Load Environment  
```bash
source ../../.env
```
**What this does:** Loads all configuration variables into your environment.

### Step 3: Run the Notebook
```bash
# Open the notebook and run all cells
adx/notebooks/03-security-pentesting-adx.ipynb
```
**What this does:** Generates 120+ realistic security tests with AI analysis and exports to ADX.

## ✅ Success Criteria

After completing the steps above, you should have:

- ✅ ADX cluster running with TracingDB database
- ✅ 3 tables with schema: SecurityTraces, LLMInteractions, OTelTraces  
- ✅ 7 analytical functions for security queries
- ✅ 120+ security test records with AI analysis
- ✅ Ready-to-use KQL queries for insights

## 🔗 Quick Links

- **ADX Web UI**: https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/adx-viytdz.eastus/databases/TracingDB
- **Azure AI Foundry**: https://ai.azure.com
- **Validation Script**: `./validate-adx-setup.sh`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Command not found" errors
```bash
# Install missing tools
az login
# Install Terraform: https://terraform.io/downloads
```

### ❌ "Permission denied" errors  
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x adx/terraform/*.sh
```

### ❌ "ADX not configured" in notebook
```bash
# Re-run the deployment
cd adx/terraform && ./deploy-adx-complete.sh
source ../../.env
```

### ❌ Notebook fails to connect
```bash
# Validate the setup
cd adx/terraform && ./validate-adx-setup.sh
```

## 💡 What You Get
