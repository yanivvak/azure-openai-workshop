    "\n",
    "### Common Issues and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent Creation Fails\n",
    "- **Problem**: \"Agent service not available\" or permission errors\n",
    "- **Solution**: \n",
    "  - Verify Azure AI Foundry project has Agent Service enabled\n",
    "  - Check your Azure permissions and role assignments\n",
    "  - Ensure you're using a supported model deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tool Calls Not Working\n",
    "- **Problem**: Agent doesn't use tools or tool calls fail\n",
    "- **Solution**:\n",
    "  - Check tool function descriptions are clear and specific\n",
    "  - Verify tool parameter schemas are correct\n",
    "  - Implement proper error handling in tool functions\n",
    "  - Check that tool call handling logic is working\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory/Context Issues  \n",
    "- **Problem**: Agent doesn't remember previous conversation\n",
    "- **Solution**:\n",
    "  - Ensure you're using the same thread ID across messages\n",
    "  - Check thread message history with list_messages\n",
    "  - Verify conversation context isn't being lost\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Issues\n",
    "- **Problem**: Agent responses are slow or time out\n",
    "- **Solution**:\n",
    "  - Implement timeouts for tool calls\n",
    "  - Optimize tool function execution time\n",
    "  - Use simpler tool descriptions\n",
    "  - Check Azure service quotas and limits\n",
