The process of making maple syrup begins by tapping a spout (sometimes called a spile) into the sugar maple tree. The spile is inserted into the tree about 2 inches deep and the sap is collected as it flows out. The sap is then taken to a sugar shack where it is boiled down to concentrate the sugars. As the sap boils, water in the sap is evaporated and the syrup becomes more and more thick. Once the syrup reaches the right sugar content, which is usually when the boiling point reaches 219 degrees Fahrenheit, it is bottled and enjoyed.
